== Description suggested by user [jhnpldng](https://wordpress.org/support/users/jhnpldng/) ==

Allows to automatically assign a WooCommerce Customer to an Asgaros Usergoup based on their Order Status in WooCommerce.
Each of the following WooCommerce Order Statuses can be assigned their own Asgaros Usergoup.

* Pending payment
* Processing
* On hold
* Completed
* Canceled
* Refunded
* Failed

That is seven Order Statuses and you can assign each one to a different Asgaros UserGroup.

= Example Usage: =
Assign Order Pending customer to a Usergoup that only has access to a Welcome forum. When their order changes to Completed, they get assigned to a Usergroup that has full forum access.
If their order status changes to Failed, Refunded or Canceled, you could assign them to a Usrgroup that has no access to any forum.

= A more basic example usage: =
When Order Status is Completed, assign them to a Usergroup called Customer and give them access to the forum.
